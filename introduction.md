Technology exists to improve the lives of people around the world. The creation of new technology is neither a simple nor inexpensive endeavor. However, with planning and skill we have the ability to greatly reduce the magnitude of each of these costs.

It isn't possible to predict the future, but by creating a deeper understanding of the business domains, consumer issues, solution spaces, and architectural patterns available to us, we can prepare for changes the future will bring. This may sound like a nearly impossible task, but it turns out this a lot more feasible when you learn the art of identifying the problem you are trying to solve and pairing it with the right patterns and techniques.

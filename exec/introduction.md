# Building Digital Systems

Welcome to the age of augmented reality. The days of the digital physical divide are gone. Your life, your business, your world have changed. Acceling in this world requires new perspective. Shaping your perspective and the world around you requires new tools. Success in a digitally augmented world requires mastery of a whole new set of skills.

To Jump one must first stand. To run one must first walk. To change the world one must first percieve it.

"Leaders are not responsible for the results, leaders are responsible for the people who are responsible for the results. And the best way to drive performance in an organization is to create an environment in which information can flow freely, mistakes can be highlighted and help can be offered and received."

"The ability to succeed is not what makes someone a leader. Exhibiting the qualities of leadership is what makes someone an effective leader. Qualities like honesty, integrity, courage, resiliency, perseverance, judgment and decisiveness."

"An infinite mindset embraces abundance whereas a finite mindset operates with a scarcity mentality. In the Infinite Game we accept that "being the best" is a fool's errand and that multiple players can do well at the same time."

Leadership in the digitally augmented world is primarily effected by humility, trust, perception, and communication. As the information age peaked, it was leadership being disrupted not companies. Managers, not workers. Greed of the few, not the virtue of the many. For the first time in human history, the end consumer joined the leadership judgement feedback loop. And the rules changed.

The world hardly noticed it had passed the inflection point. But some did.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Amazon's mission is to continually raise the bar of the customer experience. Alibaba's mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. SpaceX's mission is to make life multiplanetary. Every one of these organizations exemplify something simple, something profound, something leaders find incredibly difficult to accept: Their customer is more important than they are. It seems ironic then that Elon Musk, Jack Ma, and Jeff Bezos all became exceptionally wealthy. Only, it's completely predictable. This will continue until more leaders understand their new reality.

Achieving lofty goals is done by understanding the needs within a system and meeting those needs. One does not work directly on, nor directly provide, outcomes. All of these organizations have a simple, public, shared objective. They told everyone their secret to success. So few have listened.

The secret to building digital systems is to focus on making the whole system better. That's it.

This is not a leadership book, nor is it a business or technology book. This is a guide, a map, to start your journey of building systems for a digitally augmented world. I hope to convey three key understandings which will transform the way you interact with your organizations, customers, and the world.
* Architectural decisions made with short time horizons are existential threats to your organization. //Is this the evolutionairy arch one?
* The goal of technology is to enable the optimal state of the entire system. Out of many possible changes technology can enable, the global maximum will often require changes to other parts of the system. It is critical technology is _not_ used to compensate for these mistakes.
* The entire system must communicate using the same concepts and and interaction patterns. Technical systems must elevate communication abstractions to the level of all actors in the system. Ambiguous or implicit specification of concept or intent is at best a local maximum and is an impediment to future evolution.
//* Technical systems must seek alignment with the larger system, and influence changes in other portions of the system. This includes physical, domain, and organizational systems. The goal of technology is not to have the optimal technical system, it is to enable the optimal state of the entire system.
* Evolutionairy architecture is enabled by making choices with minimum change and maximize the set of future choices.

# Building Digital Systems

Welcome to the age of augmented reality. The days of the digital physical divide are gone. Your life, your business, your world have changed. Acceling in this world requires new perspective. Shaping your perspective and the world around you requires new tools. Success in a digitally augmented world requires mastery of a whole new set of skills.

To Jump one must first stand. To run one must first walk. To change the world one must first percieve it.

"Leaders are not responsible for the results, leaders are responsible for the people who are responsible for the results. And the best way to drive performance in an organization is to create an environment in which information can flow freely, mistakes can be highlighted and help can be offered and received."

"The ability to succeed is not what makes someone a leader. Exhibiting the qualities of leadership is what makes someone an effective leader. Qualities like honesty, integrity, courage, resiliency, perseverance, judgment and decisiveness."

"An infinite mindset embraces abundance whereas a finite mindset operates with a scarcity mentality. In the Infinite Game we accept that "being the best" is a fool's errand and that multiple players can do well at the same time."

Leadership in the digitally augmented world is primarily effected by humility, trust, perception, and communication. As the information age peaked, it was leadership being disrupted not companies. Managers, not workers. Greed of the few, not the virtue of the many. For the first time in human history, the end consumer joined the leadership judgement feedback loop. And the rules changed.

The world hardly noticed it had passed the inflection point. But some did.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Amazon's mission is to continually raise the bar of the customer experience. Alibaba's mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. SpaceX's mission is to make life multiplanetary. Every one of these organizations exemplify something simple, something profound, something leaders find incredibly difficult to accept: Their customer is more important than they are. It seems ironic then that Elon Musk, Jack Ma, and Jeff Bezos all became exceptionally wealthy. But it isn't.

Achieving lofty goals is done by understanding the needs within a system and meeting those needs. One does not work directly on, nor directly provide, outcomes.
